This is an attempt at creating a CLI for Art of Illusion.

Sorry, no ant buildfile yet. How to compile / run:
 - Create a symbolic link or copy of ArtOfIllusion.jar in the same
   directory as run.sh.
 - Create /tmp/test.aoi or change the path in run.sh.
 - The test scene's main camera needs to be called "Camera 1".
 - Compile and run:

	$ ./run.sh

 - No image will be rendered or saved. See lines ~70 in
   headless/Controller.java.
