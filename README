This is an attempt at creating a CLI for Art of Illusion. The main
target is to allow real headless rendering.

Sorry, no ant buildfile yet. How to compile / run:
 - Create a symbolic link or copy of ArtOfIllusion.jar in the same
   directory as run.sh.
 - Create /tmp/test.aoi or change the path in run.sh.
 - The test scene's main camera needs to be called "Camera 1".
 - Compile and run:

	$ ./run.sh

 - If you use the original ArtOfIllusion.jar, it won't even compile. You
   have to apply the ArtOfIllusion.patch to your ArtOfIllusion.java so
   that my program can order AoI to load its properties.
 - That patch is pretty simple. :) See headless/Controller.java why it
   is needed.
